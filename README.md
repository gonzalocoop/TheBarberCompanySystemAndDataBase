The project aimed to automate key processes at "The Barber Company." The technologies used included C# for interface development and SQL Server for data management, adopting an object-oriented design to ensure modularity and code reuse.
Because the .vs file was deleted, when opening the code, you must set the presentation layer as the startup project for the program to run.

Also, remember to change the name of your SQL server in the App.config for the data and presentation layers to access the database.
It is also IMPORTANT to use the .txt script to create and populate the database.
